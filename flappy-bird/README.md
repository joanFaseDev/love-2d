# Flappy Bird

- **Parallax scrolling**: technique in computer graphics where two images (usually background and foreground) moves at different speed therefore creating an illusion of depth.

## Done since last commit
- Create the Pipe class
- Declare a local variable and assign it the pipe image. That way, no matter how many pipes we create, there will only be one image.
- Declare a local variable representing the pipe's scrolling x axe
- Create the Pipe constructor
